# Motivation
What bash scripting is all about is to combine multiple commands in a single bash scipt such that a single
call to this bash script executes all commands.

# Bioinformatics background

Here we will work with a mutliple sequence alignment of mitochondrial genomes of Anopheles species.
If we are interested only in individual genes within this alignment and want to extract them, a script allows us to extract
all sequences in one go.

First let us download the sequence file used in Fontaine et al. 2015 ().


A good introduction is simple task in which we combine multiple program calls in a single bash script.
